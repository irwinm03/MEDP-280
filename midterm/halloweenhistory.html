			<h2>History of Halloween</h2>
			<p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated on October 31st. This originated from an ancient Celtic festival, where people would wear costumes and light bonfires to ward off ghosts. It was originally called All Hallows Eve because in the 8th century, Pope Gregory III made November 1st as a day to honor all saints. Before Halloween is what it is today, the Celtics used to call it Samhain. It is a pagan religious festival that welcomes in the harvest and usher in the "dark half of the year." People used to believe that during Samhain, the barriers between the physical and spirit world would break, allowing the two worlds to interact. However, Halloween today is also derived from ancient Irish and Scottish practices. Trick-or-treating is one of them. In Ireland, the practice of putting on costumes, going door to door and singing to the dead was a common celebration. The singers would recieve cakes.</p>
