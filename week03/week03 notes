class: tags with literal "class='xyz"
Psuedo class: anything with the same tag type, a.k.a, "nav a:hover"

html non-semantic elements

<div> </div> block eleemnt. no margin. makes a block.
<span> <span> inline element. does nothing without css.



First rule of thumb in css sheet:
body

https://fonts.google.com/

so to get fonts from google,
u can find a font, then get font, then go to embedded link and copy the CSS section code. U must ALSO copy the html code into your html file. can paste under the link of the style sheet. :)
