				<h3>Biography</h3>

							<!-- the 'target="_blank"' means to open in a new tab -->
				<p>Hello, my name is <a href="https://fanatical-pine-specialist.glitch.me/home.html" target="_blank">Irwin Mok</a>.
				I am a student at Hunter College and I am majoring in Media Studies with a concentration in Emerging Media.</p>
			
				<p>I am currently a senior and still exploring all the things that I think are interesting.</p>

				<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

					<blockquote><em> My art involves pictures. I like photography and enjoy taking pictures of moments that impact me deeply. Whether it's the warm light shining onto me during the afternoon, or the way the street is aligned to create a unique picture, art is something that allows me to express emotions that I can somehow put into a pocket and everytime I look at it, evoke that specific feeling. Art Museums are also a new interest of mine. It came with my interest in photography. A I discover more mediums of art, there are many things that I can look at for hours and things I will not bat a second eye at. However, all art is subjective and I do believe that art can be for everyone. Recently, I have been associating pictures with music. When one part of a song perfectly aligns with the scenary I am in, I like to take a picture so that when I look back, my mind will automatically link that image to the song. </em></blockquote>
